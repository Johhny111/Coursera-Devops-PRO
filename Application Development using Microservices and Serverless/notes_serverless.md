## Serverless - intro

Infrastructure management is invisible for end users with serverless computing. Serverless computing enables developers to focus on the business-specific needs in their applications. Serverless code runs on-demand and scales transparently. Pay-as-you-go server consumption means that users never pay for idle capacity.

## Serverless - pros and cons

 - no infra requirements
 - fault tolerant
 - focus on coding
 - per request charging bases

serverless architectures remove the need for infrastructure management and are reliable, because cloud providers ensure fault-tolerance. You also learned that serverless is well-suited for spiky workloads that can afford some latency, but that long-running applications are better run elsewhere. Finally, you learned that serverless can lead to vendor lock-in and doesnâ€™t always support every programming language.
