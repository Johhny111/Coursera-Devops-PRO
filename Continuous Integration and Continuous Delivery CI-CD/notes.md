ci is an automation project that allows you to constantly merge code into the main branch
plan code build test

cd prepares code for deployment (production like environment)
release deploy operate

continuous deployment (deliver to production)

build test is the devops time when ci cd happens

#### benefits
 - faster reaction times to code
 - reduced code integration risk
 - more testing 
 - more code review.

### platform and tools

gitlab
bitbucket
github

Jenkins - central building software
Travis CI - hosted ci service
circle CI - platform for devops
github actions - only works with github.

### what is infrastructure as code

textual file format that can build servers and storage and networks

Terraform
Ansible
Chef
Puppet - declarative
