# week 1 intro to agile and scrum

# Introduction to Agile Development and Scrum

Agile projects fail is inexperience with implementing and integrating the Agile methodology.

executive leadership needs to change their long-term focus and instead focus on delivering value quickly and iteratively to delight their customers.

**agile needs practicing**

and how at the end of every iteration you should ask yourself, "Do we pivot, or persevere?"

# Agile Principles

define the Agile philosophy -

   ‚ÄúAgile is an **iterative** approach to project management that allows teams to be responsive and deliver value to their customers **quickly**.‚Äù small incriments and feedback

describe the characteristics of Agile -

   adaptive planning (short term, small iterations, get feedback)

   evolutionary development (building in small increments)

   early delivery (getting feedback, pivot or persevere)

   continual improvement

   responsiveness to change

explain the philosophy of the Agile Manifesto -

   1. to value individuals and interactions over processes and tools,
   2. working software over  documentation,
   3. customer collaboration over contract negotiation,
   4. and responding to change over following a plan.

   *we value the items on the left more than the items on the right*

agile software development is agile appplied to software devs

transparency is important, small cross functional teams

‚Äúbuild what is needed, not what was planned‚Äù

# Methodologies Overview

waterfall development

   requirements, design, code, integration, testing, deploy

   all are phases with input and exit criteria, no provision for change

   teams are in silos

extreme programming

values of x.p. :

   simplicity, communications, feedback, respect, courage

kanban:

   comes from japanese manufacturing:

   visualize then work

   limit the work in progress (WIP) üöß üèó ‚ö†Ô∏è

   manage and enhance the flow

   make policies explicit (define what it means to be done)

   continuously improve

# Working Agile

working in small batches(from lean manufacturing)

   fast feedback

use minumum viable products (MVP)

   ‚Äú *A minimum viable product is the minimal thing that you can do to prove a hypothesis and gain learning and gain understanding.‚Äù* closer to what the customer really really wants

behaviour driven developement (BDD) - build the right thing

   **from the outside in**

      **scenario - user story üôÇ**

      as a (role)

      i need (some function)

      so that (Some business value)

      **gherkin syntax**

      **given** a set of preconditions

      **when** some event happens

      **then** some outcome is observed

test driven development (TDD) - building the thing right

   from the inside out, write a testcase first then write code to the make it pass

   red green refactor

pair programming (PP)

   2 programmers working together at 1 workstation

   20 min increments

   higher code qulity :)

   writing the code is the cheap part.

# Summary and Highlights

Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:

- Agile is an iterative approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, interactivity, and transparency using small, cross-functional teams
- The Agile Manifesto describes the core values of Agile:
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan
- The waterfall approach is a structured, step-by-step process that can lead to problems not surfaced until later in development
- Extreme Programming (XP) advocated an iterative approach that valued simplicity, communication, feedback, respect, and courage
- A Kanban system is characterized by visualizing workflow, limiting work in progress, managing and enhancing flow, making process policies explicit, and continuously improving a process
- Working in small batches means delivering something useful quickly
- An MVP is the cheapest/easiest thing you can do to test a hypothesis and learn
- Behavior Driven Development makes sure you are building the right thing
- Test Driven Development makes sure you are building the thing right
- Pair programming enables you to discover defects earlier and increase your code quality
- The Gherkin syntax, which comes from a company called Cucumber, is a single syntax that developers and stakeholders can understand: given some set of preconditions, when an event occurs, then some outcome is observed.

# Scrum Overview

agile and scrum have a difference

agile is a philosophy

scrum is a method, management framework

sprint (2 weeks long)

   1 sprint is 1 iteration

STEPS IN THE SCRUM PROCESS

![Image.png](/assets/images/Image%20(48).png)

daily standup -

   what did you do yesterday?

   what did you do today?

   what are your blockers

# The 3 Roles of Scrum

what does a product owner does

what does a scrum master do - mentor for the scrum process

scrum team - (dev team) - cross functional team

**product owner** - represents stakeholder interest, liason, articulate the product vision, final arbiter fo requirements quesions, product backlog and storie groomer. accept or reject product increment, decide wether to ship

**scrum master** - scrum experts with experience‚Ä¶ they are agile coaches, they coach the team. shield the team from the external work, rewolve impediments (blockers) enforce the timeboxes.. capture experience data, no management authority over the team, part of the team not management (needs honesty)

**scrum team** - cross functional team (doing devops) self managing and self assign their own work‚Ä¶ 7 + or - 2, no loners, dedicated to single teams and single products. negotiate commitments one sprint at a time.

In this video, you learn that the product owner represents stakeholders, articulates the product vision, and decides priorities, requirements, and readiness to ship. The Scrum master coaches the team, promotes a cooperative environment, shielding the team from interference and unblocking impediments. The Scrum team is small, dedicated, co-located, cross- functional, and self-managing. The Scrum team negotiates commitments with the product owner one sprint at a time. The Scrum team has autonomy regarding how to reach its commitments.

# Artifacts, Events, and Benefits

**artifacts**

   product backlog (all the stories ever)

   sprint backlog (whats gonna be done in the next sprint)

   done increment (product increment at the end of the sprint)

**events**

   sprint planning meeting (planning)

   daily stand up (sync)

   sprint itself

   sprint review (demo time

   sprint retrospective (what went well, what went not so well, what can we change for the future)

**benefits**

   more productivity

   better code and product quality

   reduced time to market

   increased stakeholder satisfaction

   better team dynamics

   happier employees

scrum is not kanban

![Image.png](/assets/images/Image%20(49).png)

scrum is all about velocity - measure what matters

# Organizational impact of Agile

![Image.png](/assets/images/Image%20(50).png)

   teams should be loosly coupled

   each team has their own mission

   end to end responsibility

   long term mission

**autonomy is important**

   motivation - minimizes decisions

   fast - local decisions

   minimizes handoff and delays

devops is the only way to have a agile software development process

![Image.png](/assets/images/Image%20(51).png)

# Mistaking Iterative Development for Agile

agile is more than iterative development pretty much here the key is that the best way to get real feedback is to deploy and to listen to customers.

there are no agile project managers

# week 2 agile planning

# Destination Unknown

things are gonna keep moving - plan iteratively

measure what matters

dont decide everything at the point when you know the least.

plan for what you kow, adjust as you know more ‚Ä¶. estimates willl be more accurate.

# Agile Roles and the Need for Training

placing people in new roles without training.

product owner

![Image.png](/assets/images/Image%20(52).png)

scrum master

![Image.png](/assets/images/Image%20(53).png)

scrum teams need to be cross functional. you cant put people ina. new role without giving them training. gant charts are shit. again its a cultural shift

# Kanban and Agile Planning Tools

agile planning tools alone are not enough, tools support the process

**zenhub - github plugin - github issues can directly be turned into stories**

kanban is ‚Äî todo, doing, done (its all about visualizations)

# Creating Good User Stories

Simply put, the user story represents a  piece of business value that the team can deliver within a done increment. in the user story there should be

   1. who is it for?
   2. what do they need?
   3. why do they need it?

   assumptions or details..

   the definition of ‚Äúdone‚Äù - gherkin syntax - BDD

story description  - document a persona requesting a function to achiieve a goal

   1. as a (role)
   2. i need (some function)
   3. so that (Some business value)

Bill Wake‚Äôs INVEST - good guidelines for making stories

   independant

   negotiable

   valuable

   estimable

   small

   testable

really big stories are EPIC‚Ä¶ a collection of small stories, usually to be broken down.

**As a** [role]

**I need** [function]

**So that** [benefit]

### Details and Assumptions

- [document what you know]

### Acceptance Criteria

```other
Given [some context]
When [certain action is taken]
Then [the outcome of action is observed]
```

# Effectively using Story Points

what are story points - - its all about how difficult a story would be

![Image.png](/assets/images/Image%20(55).png)

story points are t shirt sizes

   (xs   s  m l   xl  xxl)

      (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)

story anti pattern , dont evaluate stories on wall clock time, its not about wall clock time‚Ä¶

# Building the Product Backlog

   contains all unimplemented stories

   ranked and in order (not all but atleast a few)

   stories at the top should be more detailed

# Summary and Highlights

Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:

- A user story documents a person requesting a function to achieve a goal.
- Using a template helps ensure that stories are complete.
- Defining "done" helps minimize misunderstandings.
- Use the INVEST acronym to remember the qualities of a good user story: independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, small, and testable.
- Epics can be used to capture big ideas.
- Story points are a metric used to estimate the difficulty of implementing a given user story.
- Story points are relative, like T-Shirt sizes.
- You must agree on what "average" means.
- You should never equate story points with wall-clock time.
- A product backlog is a ranked list of all unimplemented stories.
- Stories high in the ranking should have more detail than those that are lower.
- Create stories using the "As a", "I need", "So that" template to ensure everyone understands who it benefits and the business value it provides.

# Backlog Refinement: product owner

RANK ‚Ä¶ MAKE THEM SMALL ‚Ä¶ MAKE THEM DETAILED

who should be in the meeting

      product owner

      scrum master

      1 or max 2 technical people

the goal is to have a ranked backlog

make the stories sprint ready üôÇ

step by step meeting:

   new issue triage - backlog, ice box, reject

   backlog prioritizing

   provide estimates

   large items are split up - make the stories sprint ready

# Backlog Refinement 2

labels help us visualize the work . .

![Image.png](/assets/images/Image%20(56).png)

technical debt - - make it yellow yellow

   this has no direct enhancement for the customer, but its gonna make things esier for us in the future - if you dont do it things might fall apart.

**technical debt** is kinda about doing things right versus doing things fast

code refactoring is also a good example. setting up and ntesting environments, changing technilogies, changing libraries, kinda starting to feel like backend stuff.. kinda important to see why this is so importnat for devops.

do it well before the sprint meeting

![Image.png](/assets/images/Image%20(57).png)

![Image.png](/assets/images/Image%20(58).png)

each sprint should have a goal - decided by the product owner

and match the stories with the goal

dev team moves stories from the top of the backlog to the sprint backlog

what is the team velocity - its gonna be the amount of story points per sprint

you cannot compare the velocity of 2 teams.

milestones are the goals (sprint 1: counter)

build a sprint backlog from the product backlog

# Summary and Highlights

Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:

- It is the product owner's responsibility to maintain a groomed backlog
- Backlog refinement is used to order the product backlog and make stories sprint ready
- You start refinement by triaging new issues
- Large stories should be broken down until they are small enough to fit in a sprint
- The goal of backlog refinement is to get the backlog ready for the sprint planning meeting
- It is the product owner's responsibility to present the sprint goal
- It¬†is the development team‚Äôs responsibility to create a sprint plan
- A sprint plan is created by moving stories from the product backlog into the sprint backlog until the team's velocity is reached

# week 3 Daily Execution

# Workflow for Daily Plan Execution

the sprint - the sprint is one iteration throught the cycle. its usually 2 weeks and it has a goal

the daily execution: ‚Äútake the highest item and move it to in progress and click on the link to assign it to yourself.

no one should be working on more than 1 feature at a time. i cannot ship 50% of 2 incomplete things. deliver and move on. unless you are blocke, but the block must be worked on.

pull request since its almost done üôÇ

# The Daily Stand Up

daily standup/daily scrum meeting.. same place and time..  15 min timeboxed meeting.

ITS NOT A STATUS MEETING

who should attend:

   scrum master

   development team

   product owner (optional) (they are not to speak)

how to handle the blockers, the scrum master is the one who handles the blockers.. scrum masters to take notes on the tables topics.

TABLED TOPICS - can be discussed after the meeting.

# Using Burndown Charts

it works off of milestones (or your 2 week sprints)

over time the story points  vs days in the sprint

![Image.png](/assets/images/Image%20(60).png)

# The Sprint Review

after having a valiable **done increment** . . demo time

done stories are closed then! not before.

everyone should attend the meeting

**feedback should be converted to backlog items**

what do you do about rejected stories, stories that are not considered done, ‚Äúunfinished‚Äù - key to close them and then make a new one, even rejected work still contributes to the velocity.

# The Sprint Retrospective

reflect on the sprint‚Ä¶ measure process health adn team health‚Ä¶ development team need the freedom‚Ä¶ scrum master and developemtn team ‚Ä¶ product owner is iffy‚Ä¶ try to leave the product owner out.. there are 3 questions again:

   what did we do well!

   what did not go well?

   what do we wanna change for the next sprint..

the goal is improvement

## What is Lean Coffee?

Lean coffee is an informal meeting designed to allow participants to set the agenda as they go. Attendees choose what they want to discuss by voting on suggested topics, meaning there is no meeting leader or set-agenda.

Small groups, ideally no more than 10, gather together informally to discuss topics of their choice. This format ensures that the meeting is ‚Äònot just another meeting‚Äô, but actually a productive use of everyone‚Äôs time.

# Summary and Highlights

Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:

- A burndown chart shows the measurement of story points completed vs story points remaining for a sprint
- Burndown charts can be used to show progress and forecast the team's probability of achieving the sprint goal
- A sprint review is a demonstration of the features that have been implemented during the sprint
- Feedback from stakeholders is critical to help shape the future of the product
- The backlog is updated based on feedback
- A sprint retrospective is a time to reflect on how the sprint went
- The sprint retrospective is attended by the scrum master and the development team
- The team must feel comfortable to speak freely
- A sprint retrospective must result in changes to improve the next sprint
- Three questions are answered on what went right or wrong:
- What went well? (keep doing)
- What did not go well? (stop doing)
- What should we change for the next sprint?

# Using Measurements Effectively

vanity metrics vs actionable metrics

you cant improve what you cant measure

A/B split testing is the best way to run experiments

and you really need goood and honest baselines to compare to the past self

actionable metrics

   1. mean lead time
   2. release freq.
   3. change failure rate
   4. mean time to recovery

# Getting Ready for the Next Sprint

end of sprint activities‚Ä¶ close all the done items

close out the current milestone

create a new sprint milestone

adjust unfinished work, sprint backlog moves to the top to the product backlog , dont automatically move them to the next sprint.

unfinshed story, give them credit for the velocity, split the story points to a new story.. unfinished label, closing out the sprint, write a new story for the remaining story points..

keep the velocity accurate

In this video, you learned that it is important to give developers credit for unfinished stories, unfinished stories should be split into new stories to complete the work in the next sprint, each sprint milestone should be closed when completed to reflect the velocity of the sprint, and you should create a new milestone for the next sprint.

# Agile Anti-Patterns and Health Check

- no real product owner (visionary)
- teams are too large
- teams are not dedicated to the team or to the buisinesss case
- if the teams are toooo distributed
- teams should not be siloed
- teams are not self managing

health check

everyone is accouintable and co responsible

working in small sprints

there is an ordered product backlog

there is an ordered sprint backlog

organise the sprint around a goal

re planning during the scrum

post sprint there needs to be a done increment

stake holders feedback.
